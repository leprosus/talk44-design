# TALK44: Project documentation

# Idea

## Hypothesis

1. After long-lasting pandemic isolation people may get bored of meetings in the real world. In order to encourage people to return to their previous activity, it is needed to give them a tool that will help organize everything.
2. The new pro-online generation can be unable to find offline friends and communication. There is required a tool with gamification to help them study new communication skills.

## Practice

For last year my friends and me have been creating small meetings with the following rules:
- a meeting have been visited only four persons;
- all persons must have different professional skills;
- they choose a convenient place/date/time for a meeting;
- they agree about main topic for future meeting;
- after a meeting, everybody gives feedback about each other and if somebody looks unpleasant then the person is going to be excluded.

### Question-Answer

Q: Why are only 4 persons?

A: Because the number of people is enough for long discuss without any pauses and competition.

---

Q: For what the rules if I can make a meeting with my friends it myself?

A: You are not the target audience.

---

Q: Why do we need these rules?

A: Without rules and restrictions, people can't get involved in the process - everything turns into chaos.

---

Q: What happens if I break the rules?

A: We are glad to meet you, but after the meeting we will say goodbye to you.
